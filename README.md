# taperecorder_digital_equalisation

This repository contains the code related to paper:

Niccolò Pretto, Nadir Dalla Pozza, Alberto Padoan, Anthony Chmiel, Kurt James Werner, Alessandra Micalizzi, Emery Schubert, Antonio Rodà, Simone Milani and Sergio Canazza, *A workflow and digital filters for compensating speed and equalization errors on digitized audio open-reel magnetic tapes*, 2022.

There are two main directories (**bold** indicates directory names):

- **correction**: it contains the files to perform the digital correction of an audio file resulting from the digitisation of an audio magnetic tape (see the inner README for further instructions);
- **evaluation**: it contains the files used to compare the samples described in the experiment.

## Getting Started

All code is written for Matlab R2020b. Code within **correction** directory should work also for GNU Octave, but please refer to the inner README for more information.

### Prerequisites

An activated copy of Matlab (tested on R2020b) or GNU Octave.
